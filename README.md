# How React Works Behind the Scenes

I am currently following **Jonas Schmedtmann's** course on React.js and have decided to create detailed notes for future reference. These notes will be stored in this repository. When needed, I will create diagrams in Figma to explain particular sections visually.

## Section 1: What is React?

React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. Here's a brief overview of its core principles:

- **Declarative**: We tell React what we want, and it figures out how to do it.
- **Library, not a framework**: React provides tools for UI building but doesn't impose structure like a framework.
- **Component-based**: Reusable components are the building blocks of React apps.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows from parent to child components.
- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM (JavaScript representation of the actual DOM) to optimize rendering.
- **Popularity**: React is widely used and has a large community of developers.

### What are props?

Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another, usually from parent to child components.

- They are read-only (immutable).
- Useful for configuring and customizing components, making them dynamic and reusable.

### What is state?

State represents local data specific to a component. Unlike props, state can change over time.

- **Mutable**: State can be updated using React's `setState` method (or using hooks like `useState`).
- **Triggers re-render**: When the state changes, the component re-renders.
- **Maintains UI updates**: State allows the UI to respond to user events and preserve component-specific data between renders.

## Section 2: Components, Instances, and Elements

Reactâ€™s core building blocks revolve around components, instances, and elements.

### Components

A component is a function that returns a piece of the user interface (UI) described using JSX.

```jsx
function Tab({ item }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h4>All Contacts</h4>
      <p>Content: {item}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- They describe a piece of UI, like the Tab component above.
- Components are functions that can return JSX, which is later transformed into React elements.
- A reusable 'Blueprint' or 'Template' for UIs.

### Instances

When we "use" a component, we create an instance of that component.

```JSX
    function App() {
        return (
            <div className="tabs">
                <Tab item={content[0]}/>
                <Tab item={content[1]}/>
                <Tab item={content[2]}/>
            </div>
        )
    }
```

- Instances are created whenever we use a component multiple times.
- React internally calls the component function (e.g., Tab()).
- Each instance has its own state and props, making it a "physical" representation of the component.
- We sometimes use components and component instances interchangeably (e.g. a UI is made up of components when in fact they are made of component instances) but they are different

### React Elements

When a component instance is rendered, it creates a React element.

- JSX is converted to React.createElement() function calls.
- A React element is an object containing all the information needed to render the component's DOM elements.

### DOM Elements

Once React elements are created, they are used to generate actual DOM elements (HTML) that are displayed in the browser.

- React elements are virtual representations, while DOM elements are their physical counterpart in the browser.

### Section 2 Summary

_Figure 1: Components, Instances, Elements and DOM Elements_

- **Components**: act as the blueprints or templates for the UI
- **Instances**: Physical manifestations of components with their own state and props.
- **React Elements**: Created when JSX is converted into React.createElement() calls. These elements are used to build the virtual DOM.
- **DOM elements**: The actual HTML elements rendered in the browser.
